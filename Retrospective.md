## Experience

I was able to get this entire project completed with a good amount of time left.  There weren't too many aspects that I got caught up on but the most challenging part was gettinig the styling correctly within two columns and font sizing to look decent.  Once that was done, getting the images to animate became the next challenge and I learned more about web-kits and image animation within html.  Once those aspects were done, for some reason my clear button was not correctly connecting the database and but with some simple debugging I found out the table name was not matching the current table.  This final project was not diffuclt and I felt well prepared for the aspects and requirements of it.  

## Known issues or Bugs

There were not that many known issues or bugs, other than the fact that my clear button was not correctly connected to the database due to naming issues but with some simple digging that was resolved easily.  

## Sources used

The only sources that were used outside of lecture and supplied materials was the animation techinques used in styling for the CSS flair.  Below are the links I referenced to animate the images:
